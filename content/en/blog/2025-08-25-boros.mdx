Funding rates are a cornerstone mechanism in perpetual futures markets, including major platforms like Binance Futures and Hyperliquid. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have expiration dates, perpetual contracts can be held indefinitely - but this creates a unique challenge.

### The problem they solve

Without an expiration date, perpetual contracts could drift away from the actual spot price of the underlying asset. Funding rates solve this by creating a financial incentive system that keeps perpetual prices tethered to real market values.

### How they work in practice

Let's use BTCUSDT perpetuals as an example:

- **When perpetual price > spot price**: Long holders pay shorts funding. This discourages long positions and incentivizes shorts, bringing the contract price down toward spot.
- **When perpetual price < spot price**: Short holders pay longs funding. This encourages long positions, pushing the perpetual price up toward spot level.

These payments occur at regular intervals (typically every 8 hours), creating continuous market pressure toward price equilibrium.

On Hyperliquid, funding rates are settled ***every hour***, so a 0.0025% rate (positive funding) in the example above would mean that:

- A trader with a $50,000 long position in ETHUSDT on Hyperliquid will have to pay *$50,000 x 0.0025% = $1.25* every hour (assuming the funding rate remains constant).

**Many traders rely on funding rates as an indicator of market sentiment.** For example, a positive funding rate in ETHUSDT tells us that there are more traders in long positions, and that the market is bullish. However, an *overly* positive funding rate ***may*** point to ETH being overbought.

## Introducing Boros: Trading funding rates themselves

Have you ever wondered if you could trade the direction you think a funding rate will move?

On Boros, you can proactively use this understanding to your advantage. Bullish ENA outlook and expect more traders to go long? Go long on the ENA funding rate. Think ENA is overbought and funding rates are too high? Short the ENA funding rate.

### What is Boros?

Boros is Pendle's yield-trading platform that enables margin trading of funding rates from multiple sources, including centralized exchanges. Traders can either speculate on funding rate direction or hedge their existing exposure to floating funding rates.

## How Boros works

### 1. Yield Units (YUs) - The core mechanism

Boros transforms floating funding rates into tradeable instruments called **Yield Units (YUs)**. Each YU represents the yield generated by 1 unit of the underlying collateral asset. This tokenization allows traders to buy and sell exposure to funding rate movements just like any other tradeable asset.

### 2. Opening positions & fixed APR

To trade on Boros, you deposit collateral based on your desired asset exposure. When you open a YU position for the first time, you lock in the current **implied APR** as your fixed rate, and this becomes the APR you'll pay or receive until maturity. The implied APR essentially functions as the "price" of the YU, directly affecting your position's value.

### 3. Vault system & liquidity

Each YU pair on Boros has a corresponding **vault** that provides additional liquidity beyond the traditional order book. When you place a market order, it can be matched with either other traders or the vault itself, making the vault your counterparty while earning fees and PENDLE incentives.

Vault depositors effectively take a **long-biased position on YU**, benefiting from high or rising implied APRs. However, if the implied APR declines after deposit (especially from a high level) vault positions may experience **impermanent loss (IL)**.

## Understanding YU positions: Fixed vs. Floating

### How fixed APR works

When you open a position, your fixed APR is determined by the average implied APR at the time of opening. This becomes your locked-in rate for the duration of the position.

At each settlement, Boros compares the actual underlying funding rate against your fixed rate:

### Long YU position: Pay fixed, receive floating

- **You pay**: Your fixed APR
- **You receive**: The actual underlying funding rate
- **You profit when**: Underlying rate > Fixed rate

*Example*: You open a long YU at 12% fixed APR. If the underlying funding rate is currently 17%, you receive the 5% difference (scaled to the settlement period). **You're betting that the actual funding rates will exceed your fixed payments.**

### Short YU Position: Pay floating, receive fixed

- **You pay**: The actual underlying funding rate
- **You receive**: Your fixed APR
- **You profit when**: Underlying rate < Fixed rate

*Example*: You open a short YU at 15% fixed APR. If the underlying rate rises to 22%, you lose 7% (scaled to the settlement period) because you're paying more than you receive. **You're betting that actual funding rates will stay below your fixed rate.**

## Maturity date: When positions end

Every YU has a predetermined **maturity date**. This is a crucial concept because YU essentially represents the future yield of an asset over a specific time period. The fair value of any YU position is the sum of total yield payments you'll receive (or pay) until that maturity date.

As you approach maturity, your YU position gradually realizes its value through periodic settlements. Each settlement period, you receive or pay the difference between fixed and floating rates, slowly unwinding your position's potential.

### At maturity

1. **Position value becomes zero** - Your entire position has been fully realized through the settlement payments over time
2. **Collateral is completely freed** - All payment obligations have been settled, and your deposited collateral is released

This maturity system ensures that YU positions have a clear endpoint, unlike perpetual contracts that can theoretically run indefinitely. It also means that the closer you get to maturity, the less time value remains in your position.

## Conclusion: A new frontier in DeFi trading

Boros opens up an entirely new trading dimension by making funding rates themselves tradeable assets. Whether you're a trader looking to profit from funding rate volatility, or someone seeking to hedge your existing perpetual positions, Boros provides the tools to turn funding rate movements into strategic opportunities.

As DeFi continues to evolve, platforms like this one demonstrate how traditional financial concepts can be reimagined and tokenized, creating new ways to capture value from market inefficiencies that were previously inaccessible to individual traders.
