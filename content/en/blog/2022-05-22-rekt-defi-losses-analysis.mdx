In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, **rekt** is the shorthand for suffering a severe financial loss. With the exponential growth of **DeFi**, a wave of "fast-food" scam projects emerged. But scams aren't the only reason a project gets rekt: protocols can also harbor vulnerabilities in their **smart contracts**.

I analyzed **100 representative incidents** from the De.Fi "Rekt Database" (≈**2,500** total). Amounts are in USD millions. Estimated total losses are about **US$4,500M**, while the 100-case sample covers **US$4,336M**. This sampling choice favors representativeness by value, but it may underweight the long tail of smaller incidents.

## **How projects get rekt: Four drivers**
1. **Exit Scam.** Malicious actions planned by a team intending to steal depositors’ and investors’ funds.
2. **Flash Loans.** External attacks that manipulate prices and imbalances, leading to lender losses.
3. **Smart Contract Exploits.** Internal or external vectors taking advantage of a vulnerability.
4. **Access Control.** Compromised keys that drain wallets.

## **Networks: Losses vs. Case Counts**

### **By losses**

<ImageCaption>Relationship between issue and network by **total losses**</ImageCaption>

- **Ethereum** accounts for ~48% of total losses (≈ US$2,101M).
- **Ronin** ranks second by value due to a single outsized event.
- On **Ethereum**, category shares by value are substantial: exploits ≈51%, access-control ≈59%, and flash-loan ≈72% of the losses within each category across networks.
- **Exit scams** skew toward other/smaller networks, which account for ~57% of exit-scam losses—evidence that scams often cluster on less-mature chains.

### **By number of cases**

- **Ethereum, BSC, and other/smaller networks** lead by count of incidents.
- Within **exit scams**, **BSC** becomes more prominent by count, even if not by total value.

## **Trends over time**

Since **2020**, **incident counts** have risen across all categories.

- The snapshot for **2022** may be incomplete if data collection was still underway at the time.
- **Exploits** gained relative importance by value, while **exit scams** and **access-control** remained comparatively flat in value terms.

## **Case studies: The biggest rekt events**

- **Ronin (≈US$624M).** Centralization of validator keys enabled an attacker to gather enough signatures (five validators) to approve fraudulent withdrawals, an acute governance and key-management failure.
- **Poly Network.** A cross-chain permissioning flaw allowed privileged contracts to relay messages that invoked special-privilege functions. Systems that rely on privileged calls must ensure cross-chain relays cannot access those code paths.
- **Wormhole (Solana, Feb 2022).** A bridge verification failure led to ETH being treated as deposited on Ethereum, allowing the attacker to mint the corresponding WETH on Solana.

## **Takeaways**

- **Decentralization** of key management and validator sets is non-negotiable.
- **Bridge security** and cross-chain permissioning matter as much as on-chain contract safety.
- Treat **flash loans** as a stress test: if a protocol breaks under them, the issue is in its logic or oracle design.
