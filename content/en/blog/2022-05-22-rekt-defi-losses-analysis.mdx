In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, rekt is the shorthand for suffering a severe financial loss. With the exponential growth of DeFi, a wave of “fast-food” scam projects emerged. But scams aren’t the only reason a project gets rekt: protocols can also harbor vulnerabilities in their smart contracts.
I analyzed 100 representative incidents from the De.Fi “Rekt Database” (≈2,500 total). Amounts are in USD millions. Estimated total losses are about US$4,500M, while the 100-case sample covers US$4,336M. This sampling choice favors representativeness by value, but it may underweight the long tail of smaller incidents.

## **How Projects Get Rekt: Four Drivers**
1. **Exit Scam.** Malicious actions planned by a team intending to steal depositors’ and investors’ funds.
2. **Flash Loans.** External attacks that manipulate prices and imbalances, leading to lender losses.
3. **Smart Contract Exploits.** Internal or external vectors taking advantage of a vulnerability.
4. **Access Control.** Compromised keys that drain wallets.

## **Networks: Losses vs. Case Counts**

By losses.

![Reks issues by chain](/images/rekt/2.png)

- **Ethereum** accounts for ~48% of total losses (≈ US$2,101M).
- **Ronin** ranks second by value due to a single outsized event.
- On **Ethereum**, category shares by value are substantial: exploits ≈51%, access-control ≈59%, and flash-loan ≈72% of the losses within each category across networks.
- **Exit scams** skew toward other/smaller networks, which account for ~57% of exit-scam losses—evidence that scams often cluster on less-mature chains.

By number of cases.

- **Ethereum, BSC, and other/smaller networks** lead by count of incidents.

- Within **exit scams**, **BSC** becomes more prominent by count, even if not by total value.

Trends Over Time

Since 2020, incident counts have risen across all categories.

- The snapshot for **2022** may be incomplete if data collection was still underway at the time.

- **Exploits** gained relative importance by value, while **exit scams** and **access-control** remained comparatively flat in value terms.

Case Studies: The Biggest Rekt Events

- **Ronin (≈US$624M).** Centralization of validator keys enabled an attacker to gather enough signatures (five validators) to approve fraudulent withdrawals—an acute governance and key-management failure.

- **Poly Network.** A cross-chain permissioning flaw allowed privileged contracts to relay messages that invoked special-privilege functions. Systems that rely on privileged calls must ensure cross-chain relays cannot access those code paths.

- **Wormhole (Solana, Feb 2022).** A bridge verification failure led to ETH being treated as deposited on Ethereum, allowing the attacker to mint the corresponding WETH on Solana.

Takeaways

Decentralization of key management and validator sets is non-negotiable.

Bridge security and cross-chain permissioning matter as much as on-chain contract safety.

Treat flash loans as a stress test: if a protocol breaks under them, the issue is in its logic or oracle design.

Using public sources (notably the REKT database), I pulled a subset of ~100 representative cases (~$4.336B out of the ~$4.5B total reported) and charted a few relationships.

**48%** of the total was on **Ethereum** (~$2.101B). **Ronin** appears second *by funds lost* despite having only one major incident.

- On ETH, **Exploits**, **Access control**, and **Flash loans** represent ~**51%**, **59%**, and **72%** of total losses for those issue types respectively (by value).
- “Other” networks lead **Exit scams** (~**57%**), aligning with the idea that many scams live on smaller chains.

If we make the same analysis but with quantity of cases, ETH, BSC, and “another” networks lead this. And if we see the exit scam issue, BSC becomes important.

Also, we can analyze what happens in terms of issues and years. The year 2022 could be not representative because isn’t full developed yet.


We can see that since 2020, all the types of issues have been growing in terms of quantity.


In special, the exploit issue, taking more importance than the others while Exit scam and access control remained fairly the same in terms of funds lost.

Finally, a quick look at the **three biggest rekt events**:

- **Ronin ($624M).** Related to validator **centralization**: the attacker obtained control over enough nodes (5) to authorize transactions.
- **Poly Network.** **Permissioning** error: cross-chain relay contracts could call privileged contracts, allowing the attacker to escalate privileges.
- **Wormhole (Solana).** A **bridge** exploit: the system was manipulated to credit ETH as deposited on Ethereum, enabling minting of WETH on Solana.

### Takeaways

- **Decentralization** is critical—especially for validator sets and critical ops.
- **Bridge security** is as important as on-chain contract safety.
- Defense in depth (key management, privilege separation, monitoring) is not optional in DeFi.

Focusing on **funds lost over time** shows **exploits** gaining weight vs. exit scams/access control, which remain relatively stable.
